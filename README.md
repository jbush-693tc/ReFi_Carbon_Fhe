# Regenerative Finance (ReFi) Platform for Private Carbon Credit Offsetting

The Regenerative Finance (ReFi) Platform is a cutting-edge solution that empowers individuals and organizations to anonymously purchase carbon credits and offset their carbon footprints. By leveraging **Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption technology**, the platform ensures that all transactions remain secure and private, shielding participants’ environmentally conscious actions from unwanted scrutiny and accusations of "greenwashing."

## The Pain Point: Carbon Footprint Management

As climate change accelerates, individuals and enterprises are increasingly aware of their carbon footprints. However, many face significant challenges when attempting to offset their emissions responsibly. Concerns about privacy and the risk of public backlash from "greenwashing" deter participation in carbon credit markets. Traditional solutions often compromise user data and trust, making it difficult for environmentally-concerned participants to engage genuinely.

## The FHE Solution: Privacy-First Carbon Offsetting

Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) provides a revolutionary answer to the privacy concerns surrounding carbon credit transactions. By utilizing Zama's open-source libraries, including **Concrete** and **TFHE-rs**, our platform securely encrypts all data—allowing users to conduct transactions without revealing their identity or sensitive footprint information. This ensures that every purchase of carbon credits remains confidential, enabling verified, privacy-focused carbon neutrality.

## Key Features

- **FHE Encrypted Carbon Credit Transactions:** All trades of carbon credits are secured using FHE, safeguarding user anonymity.
- **Encrypted Storage of Carbon Footprint Data:** Carbon footprint data for individuals and businesses can be securely stored and accessed without compromising privacy.
- **Verifiable Private Carbon Neutrality:** Users can achieve and prove carbon neutrality without risking their information being exposed.
- **User-friendly Dashboard:** An intuitive dashboard for calculating and offsetting carbon footprints seamlessly integrates with the platform.

## Technology Stack

- **Zama SDK:** The primary tool for confidential computing.
- **Node.js:** For server-side development.
- **Hardhat:** For Ethereum smart contract development and testing.
- **Solidity:** Smart contract programming language.
- **React:** For front-end development.

1. Unzip or download the project folder.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to install the required dependencies, including Zama FHE libraries:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

> **Note:** Please do not use `git clone` or any URLs. Ensure a local extraction of the project files.

## Build & Run Guide

To compile, test, and run the project, execute the following commands:

1. **Compile the smart contracts:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat compile
   ```

2. **Run the tests to verify everything is working correctly:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat test
   ```

3. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
   ```

### Example Code Snippet: Carbon Credit Transaction

Here is a hypothetical code snippet that demonstrates how to conduct a carbon credit transaction within the platform:

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "./ReFi_Carbon_Fhe.sol";

contract CarbonCreditExchange {
    mapping(address => uint256) public carbonCreditBalance;

    event CarbonCreditPurchased(address indexed buyer, uint256 amount);

    function purchaseCarbonCredits(uint256 amount) external {
        // Assuming encrypted transaction logic is handled with Zama SDK
        require(amount > 0, "Amount must be greater than zero");
        
        // Logic for purchasing carbon credits goes here
        carbonCreditBalance[msg.sender] += amount;
        emit CarbonCreditPurchased(msg.sender, amount);
    }
}
```

With this functionality, users can seamlessly engage in carbon credit transactions while maintaining their privacy.
